    "Predict the value of one or more continous variables based on input variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What are linear regression models?\n",
    "Simplest form of linear regression model is of course a linear function. But, much better results can be obtained by using linear combinations of a fixed set of nonlinear functions, known as basis functions. Even though some of the basis functions are nonlinear w.r.t. the input variables, they are linear function of the parameters.\n",

    "## How does regression make predictions?\n",
    "Given a training data set which includes observation and target values, the goal is to predict target value for a new observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model distribution p(target|input), which represents the uncertainty in predictions and allows minimizing expected loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the limitations?\n",
    "They can struggle with high-dimensional input spaces."
