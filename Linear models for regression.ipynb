    "## What are linear regression models?\n",
    "Simplest form of linear regression model is of course a linear function. But, much better results can be obtained by using **linear combinations of a fixed set of functions, known as basis functions**. Even though some of the basis functions are nonlinear w.r.t. the input variables, **they are linear function of the parameters**.\n",

    "Given a training data set which includes observation and target values, the goal is to predict target value for a new observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model distribution p(target|input) represents the uncertainty in predictions and allows minimizing expected loss."
